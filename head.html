Stretching 2,400 km (1,500 miles) from west to east, they separate the Indian subcontinent’s plains from the Tibetan Plateau. Within this majestic range, peaks like Mount Everest, Kangchenjunga, Lhotse, and Nanga Parbat rise to awe-inspiring heights. Glaciers, including the Gangotri and Satopanth, are nestled within these ancient peaks.</div>
